# SMART IRRIGATION

This project is a Machine Learning-based Smart Irrigation Simulation developed as part of the AICTE Internship. It predicts which sprinkler pumps should be ON/OFF based on environmental sensor data, helping optimize water usage in agriculture.




## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Sensors: 20 environmental sensors (simulated)

Sprinklers/Pumps: 3 automated pumps

Goal: Predict sprinkler activation (ON/OFF) based on sensor readings to reduce water wastage.

Interface: Streamlit web application with sliders to simulate sensor values.
## Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python 3.12.8

IDE/Environment: VS Code & Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy → Data handling & preprocessing

scikit-learn → Model training, normalization, and evaluation

joblib → Saving and loading trained ML model

streamlit → Web interface for simulation
